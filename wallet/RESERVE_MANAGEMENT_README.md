# Reserve Management System

This document describes the comprehensive reserve management system implemented for the wallet system, ensuring liquidity for swaps and trading operations.

## üè¶ Overview

The Reserve Management System maintains pools of fiat and crypto currencies to ensure immediate execution of swaps and trading operations. It provides:

- **Real-time liquidity monitoring** for all supported currencies
- **Automatic reserve allocation** for operations
- **Reserve protection** against over-utilization
- **Comprehensive analytics** and reporting
- **Admin controls** for reserve management

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Reserve Accounts**
- **System-managed accounts** for each currency and type
- **Automatic creation** when needed
- **Dedicated labeling** (e.g., `RESERVE_USDT_CRYPTO`)
- **High-precision balance tracking**

### 2. **Reserve Monitoring**
- **Real-time balance status** with utilization percentages
- **Health indicators**: Healthy, Moderate, Warning, Critical
- **Caching system** for performance optimization
- **Automatic status updates**

### 3. **Reserve Operations**
- **Amount reservation** for pending operations
- **Automatic release** on completion or failure
- **Top-up and withdrawal** capabilities
- **Transaction tracking** for all operations

### 4. **Integration with Services**
- **Swap operations** check and reserve both currencies
- **Mobile money operations** reserve appropriate currencies
- **Automatic rollback** on operation failures
- **Seamless user experience**

## üîß Architecture

### ReserveService Class
```python
class ReserveService:
    def __init__(self, session: Session):
        self.session = session
        self.reserve_accounts = {}  # Cache for reserve accounts
        self.reserve_cache = {}     # Cache for balance data
        self.cache_ttl = 30        # 30 seconds cache TTL
```

### Key Methods
- `get_reserve_account()` - Get or create reserve account
- `get_reserve_balance()` - Get current balance and status
- `check_reserve_sufficiency()` - Check if operation can proceed
- `reserve_amount()` - Lock amount for operation
- `release_reserve()` - Release locked amount
- `top_up_reserve()` - Add funds to reserve
- `withdraw_from_reserve()` - Remove funds from reserve

## üìä Reserve Status Levels

### Utilization Thresholds
- **Healthy**: 0-50% utilization
- **Moderate**: 50-75% utilization
- **Warning**: 75-90% utilization
- **Critical**: 90%+ utilization

### Status Calculation
```python
utilization = (locked_balance / total_balance * 100) if total_balance > 0 else 0

if utilization >= 90:
    status = "critical"
elif utilization >= 75:
    status = "warning"
elif utilization >= 50:
    status = "moderate"
else:
    status = "healthy"
```

### Clear Reserve Cache
```http
POST /wallet/reserves/cache/clear

## üîÑ Integration with Swap Operations

### Reserve Check Process
1. **Check from currency reserve** for sufficient balance
2. **Check to currency reserve** for sufficient balance
3. **Reserve both amounts** with unique reference IDs
4. **Execute swap** with reserved amounts
5. **Release reserves** on completion or rollback on failure

### Example Integration
```python
# Check and reserve from currency
from_reserve_check = self.reserve_service.check_reserve_sufficiency(
    from_currency, from_amount, AccountType.CRYPTO, "swap"
)

if not from_reserve_check["is_sufficient"]:
    return {"error": "Insufficient system reserve"}

# Reserve amounts
from_reserve_result = self.reserve_service.reserve_amount(
    from_currency, from_amount, AccountType.CRYPTO, 
    f"{reference_id}_from", "swap"
)
```

## üì± Integration with Mobile Money

### Buy Operations (Fiat ‚Üí Crypto)
1. **Check crypto reserve** for sufficient balance
2. **Reserve crypto amount** for the operation
3. **Initiate mobile money payment**
4. **Release reserve** on payment completion or failure

### Sell Operations (Crypto ‚Üí Fiat)
1. **Check fiat reserve** for sufficient balance
2. **Reserve fiat amount** for the operation
3. **Lock crypto amount** from user account
4. **Process mobile money payout**
5. **Release reserves** on completion
