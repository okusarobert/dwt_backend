# Simplified Trading System

## Overview

The trading system has been simplified to use the existing Relworx implementation instead of creating duplicate mobile money logic. This approach reduces complexity and leverages the proven deposit/withdraw functionality.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Complexity
- **Deleted**: `wallet/mobile_money_service.py` (32KB of duplicate code)
- **Simplified**: Trading service now uses existing Relworx client directly
- **Fixed**: SQLAlchemy metadata field name conflict

### 2. Unified Fee Structure
- **All payment methods**: 1% fee (previously varied from 0.5% to 2.5%)
- **Consistent**: Same fee structure for mobile money, bank deposit, and vouchers
- **Transparent**: Fee is clearly displayed to users

### 3. Existing Relworx Integration
- **Buy trades**: Use `request_payment()` method (same as deposits)
- **Sell trades**: Use `send_payment()` method (same as withdrawals)
- **Webhooks**: Use existing Relworx webhook handlers
- **No duplication**: Reuses proven payment processing logic

## Implementation Details

### Mobile Money Processing
```python
# Simplified approach - uses existing Relworx client
response = self.relworx_client.request_payment(
    reference=f"TRADE_{trade.id}",
    msisdn=trade.phone_number,
    amount=float(trade.fiat_amount),
    description=f"Buy {trade.crypto_currency} - DT Exchange"
)
```

### Fee Calculation
```python
def _get_fee_percentage(self, payment_method: PaymentMethod) -> float:
    """Get fee percentage based on payment method"""
    # All payment methods now have 1% fee
    return 0.01  # 1%
```

### Database Model
- **Fixed**: `metadata` field renamed to `trade_metadata` to avoid SQLAlchemy conflicts
- **Consistent**: All webhook handlers updated to use `trade_metadata`

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Code Complexity**: Removed 32KB of duplicate mobile money logic
2. **Proven Reliability**: Uses existing, tested Relworx implementation
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for mobile money processing
4. **Consistent User Experience**: Same payment flow as deposits/withdrawals
5. **Simplified Testing**: Can reuse existing Relworx test cases

## Testing

Run the simplified trading test:
```bash
cd wallet
python test_simplified_trading.py
```

## Webhook Integration

The system maintains the same webhook approach as the existing Relworx implementation:

- **Buy completion**: `/api/webhooks/buy-complete`
- **Sell completion**: `/api/webhooks/sell-complete`  
- **Trade status**: `/api/webhooks/trade-status`
- **Relworx payments**: `/api/webhooks/relworx`

All webhooks include HMAC signature verification for security.

## Migration Notes

- **Database**: Run Alembic migrations to add new trading tables
- **Environment**: Ensure `RELWORX_API_KEY` and webhook secrets are configured
- **Frontend**: Update to use new `/api/v1/trading/` endpoints
- **Monitoring**: Use existing Relworx monitoring for payment status

## Next Steps

1. **Test the simplified implementation** with real Relworx payments
2. **Monitor webhook delivery** and payment processing
3. **Add additional payment methods** using the same simplified pattern
4. **Implement real-time notifications** via WebSocket for trade updates
